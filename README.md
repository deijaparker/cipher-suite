# Cipher Suite

**Cipher Suite** is a message encryption service that provides various encryption methods to transform input text. This project includes three encryption techniques:

- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts the characters of the input message alphabetically by a given amount.
- **Symbol Cipher**: Replaces select characters from the input message with visually similar symbols.
- **Reverse Cipher**: Reverses each word in the input message in place.

## Features

- **Encryption Methods**:
  - `Caesar Cipher`
  - `Symbol Cipher`
  - `Reverse Cipher`
- **Modular Design**: Encryption functions are separated into modules, making the code easy to maintain and extend.
- **Encoding & Decoding**: Users can encode and decode messages using combined encryption methods.
